TrueSpot Signal Quantification Bash Wrapper
Usage Manual

--- Input/Output Options ---
-runinfo [Path]				MAT file (generally ending in "_rnaspotsrun.mat") produced by the Spot Detection module. Contains links and run parameters.
-tif [Path]					File containing image/stack to be analyzed. (Default: Path stored in provided run info)
-outdir [Path]				Directory to place results files in (Default: Directory of primary input file)
-cellsegpath [Path]			File containing a 2D or 3D cell segmentation mask. Accepts CellSeg module MAT outputs, single channel TIF, and unheaded csv or tsv.
-nucsegpath [Path]			File containing a 2D or 3D nuclear segmentation mask, if different from cell mask. Accepts CellSeg module MAT outputs, single channel TIF, and headerless csv or tsv. (Default: cellsegpath)
-coordtable [Path]			File containing xyz coordinates of maxima calls made by a spot detector. Accepts call tables output by spot detect module or headerless text tables (csv or tsv) with columns ordered x,y,z. (Default: Path referenced by spotsrun, if provided)
-ch [Int]					The channel in the input image stack to process as sample. 1-based coordinates. (Default: 1, or value stored in spotsrun)
-chcount [Int]				The total number of channels in the input image stack. (Default: 1, or value stored in spotsrun)

--- Threshold Options ---
-mthresh [Int]				Threshold value to use to obtain starting calls (Default: Value stored in spotsrun)
-rethresh					(Flag) Rerun automatic thresholding using default parameters or parameters stored in spotsrun.

--- Tuning Options ---
-zadj [Float]				Ratio of distance between z-planes to xy pixel size. (Default: 1.0, or z/x ratio from runinfo voxel dimensions if stored)
-smobjsz [Int]				Maximum size of "small objects" during noise cleanup. (Default: 3)
-gaussrad [Int]				Gaussian filter radius. (Default: 7, or value stored in spotsrun)
-radxy [Int]				Pixel radius in xy to look around a maximum call during gaussian fitting. (Default: 4)
-radz [Int]					Radius in z to look around a maximum call during gaussian fitting. (Default: 2)
-norefilter					(Flag) Skip refiltering to rederive maxima list. If this flag is set, a coordinate table path is expected either directly or via the spotsrun.
-nmhi						(Flag) Use the nuclear mask derived from the high threshold (only applicable to output from CellDissect/TrueSpot's cellseg module).
-nmlo						(Flag) Use the nuclear mask derived from the low threshold (only applicable to output from CellDissect/TrueSpot's cellseg module).
-nm2d						(Flag) Use the 2D nuclear mask (only applicable to output from CellDissect/TrueSpot's cellseg module).
-nocells					(Flag) Evaluate input image as a whole instead of cell-by-cell. If this flag is set, cell segmentation paths are ignored.
-noclouds					(Flag) Skip cloud detection and only do gaussian fitting.

--- Thresholding Tuning (Presets) ---
-sensitivity [Int]		Set thresholding parameters to preset reflecting desired level of sensitivity (0-5) (Default: 0)
-precision [Int]		Set thresholding parameters to preset reflecting desired level of precision (0-5) (Default: 0)
-sensitive				(Flag) Set thresholding parameters to a preset with higher sensitivity.
-precise				(Flag) Set thresholding parameters to a preset with higher precision.

--- Performance Options ---
-workers [Int]				Number of threads to request from MATLAB. As many threads may run in parallel as there are available cores. When there is more than one worker thread, fitting/quantification can be done on multiple cells at once. (Default: 1)
