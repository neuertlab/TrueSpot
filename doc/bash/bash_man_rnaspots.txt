TrueSpot Spot Detection Bash Wrapper
Usage Manual

--- Required Arguments ---
-input [Path]			The input image or image stack. This parameter may be substituted with -tif for TIFF images, or -matimg and -matvar for MATLAB save files.

--- Input Options ---
-tif [Path]				The input image or image stack TIFF file. This argument is equivalent to -input, but is included for convenience and compatibility with previous versions.
-matimg [Path]			A MATLAB save file containing the image/image stack to process. This argument is equivalent to -input, but is included for convenience and compatibility with previous versions.
-matvar [String]		The name of the MATLAB variable in the input MATLAB save file containing the image/image stack data to process. Defaults to "imgdat".
-cellseg [Path]			A MATLAB save file containing a cell segmentation mask output by the cell segementation module. File name will usually start with "Lab_".
-ctrlimg [Path]			A control image or image stack file. Only TIFF or MAT files are recognized at this time.
-ctrltif [Path]			A control image or image stack file in TIFF format. This argument is equivalent to -ctrlimg, but is included for convenience and compatibility with previous versions.
-chtotal [Int]			The total number of channels in the input image stack. (Default: 1)
-chsamp [Int]			The channel in the input image stack to process as sample as a 1-based coordinate index. (Default: 1)
-chtrans [Int]			The TRANS or passthrough light channel in the input image stack as a 1-based coordinate index. Only used for background extraction along with cell segmentation mask.
-chctrtotal [Int]		The total number of channels in the control image stack. (Default: 1)
-chctrsamp [Int]		The channel in the control image stack to process as sample control as a 1-based coordinate index. (Default: 1)

--- Output Options ---
-outdir [Path]			Path to directory to place output files. File names will be automatically generated from image name. (Default: Directory of input image.)
-outstem [Path Stem]	Filename stem for output files including output directory. (Default: (Directory of input image)/(input image name)_(detection strategy)
-csvout [Path]			Path to output callset as a csv file.
-runparamout [Path]		Path dump run parameters to a plain text file.
-ovrw					(Flag) Overwrite any existing output.
-csvzero				(Flag) Output csv table uses 0-based coordinates instead of MATLAB default 1-based coordinates.
-csvfull				(Flag) Output csv table contains all calls at all thresholds.
-csvrange				(Flag) Output csv table contains only calls at or above the bottom of the auto-threshold range.
-csvthonly				(Flag) Output csv table contains only calls at or above the automatically called threshold.

--- Metadata Options ---
-imgname [String]		Name to assign to image and output files. Useful for images with long unwieldy file names. (Default: Input file name.)
-voxelsize (x,y,z)		Voxel dimensions in nanometers. This is only recorded as metadata and is not used or required for tool function. Functions the same as -pixelsize.
-pixelsize (x,y)		Pixel dimensions in nanometers. This is only recorded as metadata and is not used or required for tool function. Functions the same as -voxelsize.
-expspotsize (x,y,z)	Expected size of box dimensions enveloping a single spot in nanometers. This is only recorded as metadata and is not used or required for tool function.
-probetype [String]		Name of fluorescent or other probe used to illuminate sample in target channel.
-target [String]		Name of target biomolecule.
-targettype [String]	The type of biomolecule target is (eg. "lncRNA" or "Protein")
-species [String]		The species the sample was sourced from.
-celltype [String]		The cell type of the sample.

--- Detection Tuning ---
-thmin [Int]			Minimum filtered intensity threshold value to scan, inclusive (Default: 10)
-thmax [Int]			Maximum filtered intensity threshold value to scan, inclusive (Default: 500)
-ztrim [Int]			Number of Z slices to trim out from top and bottom of stack (Default: 0)
-zmin [Int]				Bottom Z slice (in 1-based coordinates) to include in processing.
-zmax [Int]				Top Z slice (in 1-based coordinates) to include in processing.
-gaussrad [Int]			Radius of Gaussian filter (Default: 7)
-nodpc					(Flag) Skip dead pixel cleaning step.
-maxzproj				(Flag) Use maximum Z projection for maxima detection instead of the full 3D stack.
-autominth				(Flag) Determine threshold scan minimum automatically from image properties.
-automaxth				(Flag) Determine threshold scan maximum automatically from image properties.

--- Thresholding Tuning (Presets) ---
-sensitivity [Int]		Set thresholding parameters to preset reflecting desired level of sensitivity (0-2) (Default: 0)
-precision [Int]		Set thresholding parameters to preset reflecting desired level of precision (0-2) (Default: 0)
-sensitive				(Flag) Set thresholding parameters to a preset with higher sensitivity.
-precise				(Flag) Set thresholding parameters to a preset with higher precision.

--- Thresholding Tuning (Detailed) ---
-mfmin [Float]			Minimum MAD factor to use for threshold range determination (Default: -1.0)
-mfmax [Float]			Maximum MAD factor to use for threshold range determination (Default: 1.0)
-wszmin [Int]			Minimum Fano factor window size to scan for threshold range determination (Default: 3)
-wszmax [Int]			Maximum Fano factor window size to scan for threshold range determination (Default: 21)
-wszincr [Int]			Increment between window sizes to try (Default: 3)
