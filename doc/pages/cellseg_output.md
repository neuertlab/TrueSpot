# Cell Segmentation Module - Output File Descriptions
This page describes the various output files generated by the Cell Segmentation module.

## MAT Files
Files with the `.mat` extension are MATLAB data files. They are generally used to store variables/data from a workspace or program or whatnot on disc for use across sessions or systems. These files contain MATLAB data structures/variables as compressed binary data and cannot be read in a text editor. However, they are by design very easy to load and view in MATLAB. In the IDE GUI this is as simple as dragging and dropping the MAT file into the workspace panel on the right that lists environment variables. Programmatically, the built-in `load` and `save` functions are all that are needed to read and write these files.

TrueSpot outputs MAT files by default simply because they are smaller than text files with the same data and it makes parsing much easier for downstream modules. However, there are options for dumping output information to standard text tables as well.
